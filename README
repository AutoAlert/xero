Xero API private application access to Xero using Java
===

This is a simple project to show you how to use Java to access your Xero data via the Xero API. 
This project uses the 2-legged OAuth approach (OAuth 1.1a),
referred to by the Xero API as Private Applications.

Step 1:  Setup a Xero application
Follow the instructions here:
http://blog.xero.com/developer/api-overview/setup-an-application/#private-apps

Step 2:  Get the Schemas
Get the latest Xero API schemas here:
https://github.com/XeroAPI/XeroAPI-Schemas

Step 3:  Download this project

Step 4:  Add the schemas to src/main/resources/XeroSchemas/v2.00/
(Delete the Xero.API.Schemas.csproj file as it will create havoc with the JAXB engine)

Step 5:  Build and Hack


This project uses the following projects:

-- Maven JAXB2 Plugin - XML to Java Object Unmarshalling --
http://confluence.highsource.org/display/MJIIP/Maven+JAXB2+Plugin
http://confluence.highsource.org/display/MJIIP/User+Guide

-- Java OAuth - OAuth implementation --
